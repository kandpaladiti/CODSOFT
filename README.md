## Task 1 - Number Guessing Game
### Overview
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This project is part of my Java Programming Virtual Internship at Codsoft. The game generates a random number within a specified range and prompts the user to guess the number with feedback until the correct number is guessed.

### Features
- Random Number Generation: Generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- User Input & Feedback: Prompts the user to guess the number and provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- Attempt Limitation: Limits the number of attempts the user has to guess the number.
- Multiple Rounds: Allows users to play multiple rounds.
- Scoring System: Displays the user's score based on the number of attempts or rounds won.

## Task 2 - Student Grade Calculator
### Overview
This project is part of my Java Programming Virtual Internship at Codsoft. It calculates students' grades based on their marks in various subjects.

### Features
- Input Marks: Takes marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject.
- Calculate Total Marks: Sums up the marks obtained in all subjects.
- Average Percentage: Calculates the average percentage by dividing total marks by the number of subjects.
- Grade Calculation: Assigns grades based on the average percentage.
- Display Results: Shows total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade.

## Task 3 - ATM Interface
### Overview
This project is part of my Java Programming Virtual Internship at Codsoft. It simulates an ATM interface with various banking operations.

### Features
- ATM Class: Represents the ATM machine.
- User Interface: Provides options for withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance.
- Methods Implementation: Includes withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and checkBalance() methods.
- Bank Account Class: Stores the user's account balance.
- Integration: Connects the ATM class with the bank account class to modify the balance.
- Input Validation: Ensures user inputs are within acceptable limits (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals).
- User Feedback: Displays messages based on transaction success or failure.
